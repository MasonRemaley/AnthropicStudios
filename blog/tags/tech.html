  <p>Hey Mason could you explain to me a safe way to use github with multiple users for a Unity project? I know a little about github, and I’ve set up the project with the Brackeys’ tutorial. That all went great. I even have the other people pulling the project onto their machines successfully. And I can successfully do a push from mine. My concern is what if they make changes, and want to push. Do I need to do a push first before they do or do they need to do a pull before they do a push? I’m a bit confused on the sequence, and in 120 the git got all screwed up and that has me concerned!</p>

<p>Normally, I reserve this blog for updates on <a href="/way-of-rhea">Way of Rhea</a>, or <a href="/2021/02/20/fullscreen-exclusive-is-a-lie/">low level engine work</a>. This post is a little different.</p>

<p>Way of Rhea is entirely self funded. Some of that funding comes from savings from when I worked full time as a programmer, some of it comes from freelance work<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and the rest comes from teaching grad and undergrad students game dev.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether I’m currently teaching grad or undergrad, Unity or engine dev, general C++ or graphics programming, there’s one key programming skill that nobody seems to ever teach my students before they get to my class: version control.</p>

<p>Fullscreen exclusive is a real thing your computer can decide to grant a window, but, as of yet I haven’t been able to find a single game where the fullscreen exclusive vs borderless window settings consistently do what you’d expect them to.</p>

          <p>This morning, I decided it was long overdue that <a href="/way-of-rhea">Way of Rhea</a> get its own icon.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/setting-a-rust-windows-exe-icon/icon.png" alt="way of rhea icon" /></figure>

<p>I believe that if you’re building a project in Visual Studio there’s a UI through which you can change your exe’s icon–but I’m not a Visual Studio user. It took me quite a while to figure out how to set an exe’s icon from the command line, so I figured I’d document what I learned here in the hopes of saving someone else some time.</p>

          <p>With Santa Cruz officially in lockdown due to COVID-19, I’ve been at home a lot working on <a href="/way-of-rhea">Way of Rhea</a>. Since I’m left without any excuse for not posting, here’s a neat proof I happened across while working on some new puzzles. :)</p>

<h2 id="symmetric-matrices">Symmetric Matrices</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">Wikipedia</a> defines a symmetric matrix as “a square matrix that is equal to its transpose.” In other words, a symmetric matrix has symmetry along its diagonal such that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m[row][col]</code> always equals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m[col][row]</code>.</p>

<p>Why should you care about symmetric matrices?</p>

<p>I dunno, you read the title and chose to click on this blog post, you tell me. <strong>I’m</strong> interested in symmetric matrices because this morning, as part of a puzzle I was working on, I added a layer system to Way of Rhea’s physics engine.</p>

<p>The layer system essentially lets me define a number of layers rigid bodies can be placed on, and then for each layer-layer pair set a boolean that indicates whether or not collisions can occur between those two layers.</p>

<figure style="position: relative">
  <a href="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/symmetric-matrices/player-orb.png">
    <img style="min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; width: 100%" src="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/symmetric-matrices/player-orb.png" alt="player facing glowing orb" />
    <figcaption style="
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0;
      color: white;
      background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      width: 100%;
    ">
      <div style="margin: 5px">
        The pink orb should not collide with the player, but it should collide with the ground.
      </div>
    </figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>

<table style="display: table; font-size: 80%">
  <tr>
    <th><i>Layers</i></th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Orb</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code></td>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Orb</th>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code></td>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code></td>
    <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So for example, rigid bodies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Layer::Default</code> can collide with rigid bodies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Layer::Character</code>, but rigid bodies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Layer::Character</code> cannot collide with rigid bodies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Layer::Orb</code>. You’ll notice that I didn’t bother filling out the top right half of the matrix. That’s because it’s symmetric! I don’t care whether an orb is intersecting with a character, or a character is intersecting with an orb; the result should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> either way.</p>

<p>In general, symmetric matrices can be used to create per-pair properties. Here’s a couple other places I’ve had this come up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution">coefficient of restitution</a> is a property of object pairs, not single objects! It’s pretty common to set it per object and then “combine” the two coefficients using some heuristic, which is totally fine most of the time, but if you want finer grained control for gameplay reasons you probably want a symmetric matrix!</li>
  <li>I believe that the same holds true for <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_friction">friction coefficients</a>. Regardless of the physical reality, it’s again possible that you’ll want fine grained control over this for gameplay reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mapping-to-a-two-dimensional-array">Mapping to a Two Dimensional Array</h2>

<p>The first two times this came up, I just hardcoded a giant match statement and kept the branches in sync manually. The third time it came up, with the layer system, I figured it was time to come up with a real solution.</p>

<p>At first I considered implementing symmetric matrices as 2D arrays. I figured I could make a triangular 2D array and swap the row/col indices when necessary to stay in the triangle, or I could just store each value twice.</p>

<p>This would have been fairly reasonable IMO, but something was nagging me…</p>

          <p>I posted <a href="https://twitter.com/masonremaley/status/1135083247598047232">this poll</a> on Twitter few weeks ago:</p>

</figure>

<p>Entity systems won by a long shot, so that’s what I’m going to be writing about today.</p>

<p>In particular, I’m going to outline the process that lead me to <a href="https://www.anthropicstudios.com/way-of-rhea">Way of Rhea</a>’s current entity system. <em>Way of Rhea</em> is being built in a <a href="https://www.masonremaley.com/projects/game-engine/">custom engine</a> and <a href="https://www.masonremaley.com/projects/scripting-language/">scripting language</a> written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, but the ideas described should still be applicable elsewhere. Hopefully this writeup will be found helpful, or at least interesting. :)</p>

<h2 id="the-ad-hoc-approach">The Ad Hoc Approach</h2>

<p><em>Way of Rhea</em>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/masonremaley/status/988634973245669377">initial prototype</a> didn’t have an explicit entity system—I wanted to get something playable on the screen ASAP to validate that the game idea was worth spending time on. Each time I wanted to introduce a new entity type, I just made a new struct, and an ad hoc decision on where to store it.</p>

<p>This approach is severely undervalued. Letting yourself be inconsistent during the early stages of a project has two big advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It lets you prototype just the thing you’re actually trying to build.</li>
  <li>It generates a lot of data on what a generic system would <em>actually need to accomplish</em>. It’s hard to build a good cart before you know anything about the horse. :)</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/entity-systems/old-editor.jpg"><img src="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/entity-systems/old-editor.jpg" alt="old level editor screenshot in game" /></a>
  <figcaption>Some entities like the player were hard coded into the all-encompassing "world" struct, while others were stored in a tile map and exposed to the editor via the pictured GUI.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As most entities in the game were fairly independent of each other, this approach served me well for almost a year. As time wore on, though, I had more and more ideas that couldn’t be expressed well in the system I’d built up…</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/entity-systems/physics-small.jpg"><img src="/assets/monsters-and-sprites/entity-systems/physics-small.jpg" alt="puzzle sketch on paper" /></a>
  <figcaption>Many of the puzzles I wanted to build involved entities being run through some sort of physics simulation, which would have been difficult to add to the existing codebase.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was going to be difficult to add things like physics puzzles to the game if there wasn’t a good way to share data and behavior between entities. This problem seemed chronic enough that it was worth solving the general case.</p>

          <p>When we built the original [<a href="/way-of-rhea">Way of Rhea</a>] demo, we only had 9 days to get it working before the <a href="https://playcrafting.com/" target="_blank">Playcrafting</a> expo we had signed up for, so we had to cut a lot of corners. Since then I’ve been doing bug fixes and working on a lot of miscellaneous <a href="https://masonremaley.com/projects/game-engine/">engine</a>/<a href="https://masonremaley.com/projects/scripting-language/">language</a> features that I either couldn’t get done in time for the demo, or didn’t realize were important until I started building it.</p>

<p>We’ve made a few game updates since then (<a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicSt/status/1010568311690743808">we now have sound!</a>), but this post is specifically going to explore some language updates I’ve made.</p>

<p>I made a bunch of smaller changes that I’m going to just gloss over here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding new compiler warnings</li>
  <li>Fixing a parser error in compound assignments for structs (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.y += 2</code>)</li>
  <li>Fixing bugs in the type checker</li>
  <li>Supporting a similar struct initializer shorthand to what Rust allows (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Vec2 { x: x, y: y }</code> can now be written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Vec2 { x, y }</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And some slightly bigger ones I’ll write about more in depth.</p>
