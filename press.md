# Description

*Way of Rhea* is an upcoming narrative driven puzzle side scroller about the space humans take up in the world. In the game, you can only interact with objects in the world that match your current color, and therefore must use the color changing orbs and teleporters scattered throughout the world to navigate its puzzles.

Anthropic Studios is a small indie studio founded in 2018 with collaborators working out of California, New York City, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania.


# History

In April of 2018, inspired by a Bennett Foddy talk, [Mason Remaley](https://twitter.com/masonremaley){:target="_blank"} decided to gather a few people to complete a challenge: build a playable game in a week. He had been working on a game engine and scripting language in his spare time, and figured it was about time to build a real game on top of it.

Soon afterwards, he got [Carolyn Whitmeyer](https://www.instagram.com/cw_visuals_insta/){:target="_blank"} on board as an artist and [Colin Quinn](mailto:colinquinnwork@gmail.com) agreed to write some music. Together, they signed up to demo their game at [Playcrafting](https://www.playcrafting.com/){:target="_blank"}'s Spring Play expo, with one catch--the game didn't actually  yet exist. Over the next 9 days they came up with the idea for the game, and put it together, finishing just in time for the expo.

They had initially planned to repeat this exercise a few more times after the expo was over, but they liked what they had created so much that they decided to instead continue work on the game they had already built. [Evan Morris](https://twitter.com/evan_cmm){:target="_blank"} who had previously helped out a bit officially joined the project as a narrative designer, and [Nick Romero](https://soundcloud.com/stonedape){:target="_blank"} as a sound designer. The game was then renamed from its working title *Monsters and Sprites* to *Way of Rhea*.

# Technology
*Way of Rhea* is being built in a custom game engine and scripting language built by  [Mason Remaley](https://twitter.com/masonremaley){:target="_blank"} in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"}. The engine supports hot swapping of all assets and scripts—in other words, the game can be edited while it is running. The engine also makes it easy to efficiently render the game's large non-repeating parallaxing backgrounds.

# Selected Articles

"The first thing that caught my eye was the game’s redesigned artwork. Not that I wasn’t a fan of the old style, but the new backgrounds I fell in love with immediately. It lends a whimsical feel that meshes well with the character design and the general concept of the game. Mason Remaley, designer and programmer of Way of Rhea, explained that artist Carolyn Whitmeyer had repainted all of the backgrounds and revamped the artwork in the span of a month, which was, quite frankly, shocking and impressive." [Tech Raptor (2019)](https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/play-nyc-2019-way-of-rhea){:target="_blank"}

"Though the demo only lasted about five or ten minutes, it was enough for me to get a good glimpse into the world of Way of Rhea, and now I’m looking forward to going back when the game releases." - Courtney Ehrenhofler, [Tech Raptor (2018)](https://techraptor.net/content/way-of-rhea-puzzle-sidescroller){:target="_blank"}

"Finally, [Way of Rhea] is a puzzle game that reminds me a bit of Hue, but unlike Hue, lays everything out in front of you, choosing to double down on a sense of whimsy as opposed to a sense of minimalist mystery.  While [Way of Rhea] is still very much early in development, I love the idea of tying color to the mechanics of a puzzle in a game. It’s a tried and true mechanic that has been used on everything from Red Doors to Blue Keys, but Indie games continue to reinvent this and re-imagine it in many ways." - Jacob Wood, [Indie Hangover (2018)](http://www.indiehangover.com/the-road-to-play-nyc-looking-good/){:target="_blank"}

# FAQ

**Will the game support mobile platforms?**

Currently only macOS and Windows support is planned. Other platforms may be considered after the initial release if there's sufficient interest.

**When will it be released?**

We're still too early in development to make any promises. :)

**Why aren't you using XXX engine?**

Fast iteration time is incredibly important to us. Our engine was built from the ground up to support instantly hot swapping out changes without ever having to reload the game.
