# Description

*Monsters and Sprites* (working title) is an upcoming game narrative driven puzzle side scroller about the space humans takes up in the world. In the game, the player can only interact with objects in the world that match their color, and must find orbs of various colors and use them at opportune moments to make their way through the world.

Anthropic Studios is a small indie studio founded in 2018 with collaborators working out of Santa Cruz, NYC, DC, and PA. All of Anthropic's games are built in an in-house engine and scripting language built on top of the fairly new [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"}.


# History

In April of 2018, inspired by a Bennett Foddy talk, [Mason Remaley](https://masonremaley.com){:target="_blank"} decided to gather a few people to complete a challenge: build a playable game in a week. He had been working on a game engine and scripting language in his spare time, and figured this would be a good first official game to build with it.

Soon after, he got [Carolyn Whitmeyer](https://www.instagram.com/nylorac0__o/){:target="_blank"} on board as an artist and [Colin Quinn](mailto:colinquinnwork@gmail.com) to write some music, and they signed up to demo their game at [Playcrafting](https://www.playcrafting.com/){:target="_blank"}'s Spring Play expo--however, the game didn't yet exist. Over the next 9 days they came up with the idea for the game, and put it together, finishing just in time for the expo.

They had initially planned to repeat this exercise a few more times after the expo was over, but they liked what they had created so much that they decided to instead continue work on the game they had already build. [Evan Morris](https://twitter.com/evan_cmm){:target="_blank"} who had previously helped out a bit officially joined the project as a narrative designer, and [Nick Romero](https://soundcloud.com/stonedape){:target="_blank"} as a sound designer.

# Selected Articles

"Finally, Monsters and Sprites is a puzzle game that reminds me a bit of Hue, but unlike Hue, lays everything out in front of you, choosing to double down on a sense of whimsy as opposed to a sense of minimalist mystery.  While Monsters and Sprites is still very much early in development, I love the idea of tying color to the mechanics of a puzzle in a game. Itâ€™s a tried and true mechanic that has been used on everything from Red Doors to Blue Keys, but Indie games continue to reinvent this and re-imagine it in many ways." - Jacob Wood, [Indie Hangover](http://www.indiehangover.com/the-road-to-play-nyc-looking-good/){:target="_blank"}

# FAQ

**Will the game support mobile platforms?**

Currently only macOS, Windows, and Linux support is planned. It's possible that after the initial release a port to mobile operating systems would be considered if there's sufficient interest.

**When will it be released?**

We're still too early in development to make any promises. :)

**Why aren't you using XXX engine?**

Fast iteration time is incredibly important to us. Our engine was built from the ground up to support instantly hot swapping out changes without ever having to reload the game.
